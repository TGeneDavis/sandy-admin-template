# sandy-admin-template
Admin template using react-router-bootstrap, using React contexts instead of Redux. Created using create-react-app.

# Purpose
I spent days looking for a free, opensource, SPA, admin template for a couple of projects that I needed one for. I couldn't find one that used the ReactJS technology stack that I needed, so I made my own. Feel free to use this to bootstart your own projects. If you have code improvements or updates that you want to add, fork this and create a pull request back into this project.
